JUST A BASIC ASSISTANT THAT WORKS WITH FACE RECOGNITION USING OPENCV


      STEPS TO USE :-
             1.) CHANGE THE PATH IN THE FACE FUNCTION TO A FOLDER WHERE YOU HAVE THE PHOTOS LOADED (MAKE SURE YOUR FACE IS VISIBLE)
             2.) GO IN THE WORK FUNCTION AND CHANGE THE NAME FROM MY NAME TO THE NAME OF YOUR SAVED PHOTO IN ALL CAPS (ex:- I HAVE A PHOTO SAVED AS Bill Gates.png  SO I CHANGE THE NAME TO BILL)
VOILA! YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF AN AI 







## THIS IS JUST A PROTOTYPE NOT FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ##
